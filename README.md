# Hi, I'm Hagai Raja Sinulingga! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate AI engineer and researcher with a strong background in computer vision, explainable AI, and multimodal data fusion. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Sejong University, specializing in applied deep learning, and have worked on several cutting-edge AI projects across industries.

## 🔍 What I Do
I'm fascinated by the intersection of AI and real-world applications. My work involves developing AI models for anomaly detection, image segmentation, object detection, and face recognition. I have a particular focus on satellite imagery, remote sensing, and defense-related technologies.

## 🧠 Key Projects
### 🛰️ **Multi-Modal Event Prediction**
- Developed few-shot segmentation and rotated object detection models for satellite imagery in South Korea's defense sector.
- Led a team in NVIDIA Boostcamp on unsupervised domain adaptation for cloud segmentation, improving image analysis for earth observation tasks.

### 🔥 **Wildfire Risk Assessment**
- Designed an earth monitoring system using deep learning segmentation models for global forest fuel mapping, aiding in wildfire risk assessment.

### 👁️‍🗨️ **Farm Intruder Detection**
- Implemented an advanced real-time intruder detection system for farms using YOLO and optical flow techniques, achieving near 100% accuracy with fine-tuning strategies.

### 🤖 **Explainable AI in Welding Defect Detection**
- Integrated autoencoder and PaDiM models for welding defect detection and applied Grad-CAM to enhance model interpretability.

### 🏠 **Building Age Prediction from Satellite Images**
- Won the MapYourCity Challenge by ESA Φ-lab with a model that accurately predicts the construction year of buildings using Sentinel-2 and street view images.
